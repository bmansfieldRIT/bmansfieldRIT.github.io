# Brian's Guitar Website

### What This Is:
This is a website, found by typing in either brianmansfield.me, or the title of this repository (bmansfieldrit.github.io)

### What This Site Does:
My site will compile a list of Tips, Lessons, Recommendations, and other knowledge I've learned from my 10+ years playing and repairing guitars.

### Why Is This Hosted On Github?
Mostly because it was cheap and easy to set up through Github Pages. But also, this means there is an effective way for anyone to collaborate and contribute their own knowledge to the page.

### Why Does This Exist?
I've gotten to the point where I've performed many mods and repairs to guitars of all kinds, and have developed into a halfway-decent guitarist myself. Now I hope to share some of the information I've learned over the years, and help others like me who want to learn more about guitar care and maintanence. There are great resources out there for guitar hackers and DIYers, but hopefully this page can stand out as a compendium of knowledge not found anywhere else.

### TODOs For This Site:
Add a resources section

#### Topics In The Pipeline Include:
###### tips:
	connecting two wires
		use a cap
		solder wires together
		twist and tape
	finding a bad connection
	put cable through strap so it wont get pulled out
	graphite/nut sauce in nut
	get a clamp for holding small parts
	get a magnifying glass on a stand
	cover work area with a towel
		pin it down to not move
		replace every once in a while
		especially if working with solder, rusty parts, etc
	never thread bass guitar into guitar amp
	keep all guitar parts
		in a specially labelled box
		seperated if possible
		if you plan on making many mods to many guitars
	go to music stores in area, ask for a deal on any broken guitars broken electronics, parts, etc.
	show where to get tiny screwdrivers
		jewelry repair kits, etc.
	always cover every surface you can when soldering near your guitar
		consider wearing thin gloves, and eye protection
		may not be neccessary with a magnifier glass in front of you
	consider aligator clips, so you can swap out resistors, capacitors, pickups, etc
	consider how much soldering you can do outside the guitar cavity as to reduce cramped space soldering

###### projects:
	<consider using a difficulty rating system>
	modding pedals
		p90
		distortion+
	replacing a tube in an amplifier
	making a basic headstock holder
	jimmy page mod
	phase switching
	coil tapping
	adding pu configurations for strat
	adding a killswitch for trills/replace with switch for complete on/off functionality
	lining guitar cavity with copper or w/e
	making a diy magnifying glass on a movable stand
	making a transistor radio amp
	installing an acoustic mic
	installing the same kind of pickup thats in my acoustic electric
		drilling underneath bridge
		threading through body
	explain how i used an old laptop to make an exclusive ubuntu guitar repair/tab laptop/entertainment
		get everything i care off it
		download ubuntu 16.x
		disk image to usb
		boot into f2/bios
		make usb main boot volume
		save/exit
		follow install instructions
		use firefox as main browser
		I bought wxxi/pbs subscription, watched vietnam war doc while fixing guitars
	replicating jimi hendrixs tone
		his was a right handed guitar flipped upside down
		explain differences in pickup placement
			string length
		so we get left handed flipped upside down
		basically replace strings
		might need to widen/replace nut
		correct intonation
	making a back pad for guitar hangers
		so it won't hit the wall
	
###### lessons:
	basic soldering
		ways to practice, with an example pot, soldering several wires to it
	on why there is a capacitor connecting volume and tone
	science behind tone control
		why putting current to ground gets rid of high end
	basic blues chunks
		like the mannish boy riff
		turnarounds
		recognizable lines from songs
	tube basics
	how to identify capacitors/resistors
	basic overview of how a current flows through guitar
		from induced current->volume->output
	explain how a speaker works
	explain difference between wire gauge
	explain difference between potentiometers
	explain difference between capacitors
	
	differences between string gauge
	explain how pickups work
		induced current
		length of wire around magnets
			it's effect on tone
		distance from strings
	explain difference between magnets
	why jimi hendrix's tone is special
		left handed guitar flipped upside down
	differences in fret size (small med jumbo)
		and what kinds of guitars usually use what
		+ pics
	explain the changes guitar wood goes through as it ages
	explain path of ground wire
		all electronics shells, pots, pickups, usually through cavity to bridge where your hand touches
		explain why touching the ground reduces hum, won't kill you
	changing strings
		how to thread properly
		stretching before tightening
	blocking a guitar tremelo system
	good practicing habits:
		make sure you're practicing with full concentration
		practicing pure finger strength exercises
			like weights, it only improves speed and limberness
			could do while watching tv
	
###### repair:
	replacing defective pots
	soldering a wire 
	repairing a broken pickup
	fixing a bad cable
	getting grime off fretboard/body
	how to remagnitize a magnet
	getting grime off frets
		can use electrical tape + steel wool
		better option is to go through other softer methods
		like oils+cloths
		if steel wool, be sure to use softest possible (000 gauge)
			and be wary of mess
			filings will stick to magnets, aka pickups
				and will get on finish, work surface, can and will scratch your guitar
			can use a magnet to pick up filings, and dispose though
	oiling guitar neck
	repairing a worn down, missing fret
	fixing a loose guitar output jack
	fixing a broken connection/replacing a guitar output jack
	
###### guitar gear essentials + installation
	strap locks
	new knobs + how to take off easily (shoestring and pull)
	tuner that sits on headstock
	pedal tuner
	invest in a looper pedal
	bass guitar
		works well with looper pedal
		make sure it does not thread into a guitar amp!!!
