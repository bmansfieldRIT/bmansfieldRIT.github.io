Another eBay special. The Ibanez Flying V is a true lawsuit guitar, made in the 80s when Gibson was suing Ibanez for copying its designs. You can find more information about "lawsuit era" guitars here:

This Particular guitar was made in 1983, and is an X Series Flying V. All research seems to point to this guitar being a solid rocker, and I can't wait to put it back together and plug it in.

The Body shows some wear, dings and scratches, but this looks like a real workhorse guitar. I'll use some polisher to try to buff out some more of the more egregious scratches. There's no point trying to get rid of all the scratches, but I could bring a good shine to this guitar, and get rid of the paint from accidental bumps.

The strap buttons are these very cool v-shaped buttons. A nice little addition. The serial number confirms it's japanese origin. The serial number can be broken down as follows:

```

The electronics are in good shape, and test fine. We'll see how they hold up when everything is put together.

The pickup is a V-2, which was Ibanez's answer to the DiMarzio Super Distortion, and according to some people on the internet (always worth listening to) it actually sounds superior.

The neck is flaking off on the edges. I can easily pull off more, which worries me, but no guitar with a coating on the fretboard lasts forever, especially if its heavily used. I think it looks cool, and it doesn't seem like it will affect the playability.
