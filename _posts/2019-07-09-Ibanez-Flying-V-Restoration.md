Another eBay special. The Ibanez Flying V is a true lawsuit guitar, made in the 80s when Gibson was suing Ibanez for copying its designs. You can find more information about "lawsuit era" guitars here:

This Particular guitar was made in 1983, and is an X Series Flying V. All research seems to point to this guitar being a solid rocker, and I can't wait to put it back together and plug it in.
