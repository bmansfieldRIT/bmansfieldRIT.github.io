If you move around a lot while you play, a good way to stop your guitar cable form being disconnected form your guitar is to thread it through your guitar strap. The cable will come out of the output jack, go back up towards the end of the guitar strap, and come out towards the back of the guitar. This way, you can be sure that the guitar cable will pull against the guitar strap and strap connector, and not pull away from the output jack. Make sure you have strap locks, if you don't have strap locks then this method could result your strap being pulled away, which is a much worse outcome than having your cable pulled away.
