Every guitar repair bench needs an elevated guitar neck/headstock rest. It keeps the headstock up off the surface, preventing scratches, detuning, and overall unnecessary damage to a sensitive part of the guitar. I didn't feel like buying one, and they seem easy to make, so I built a prototype from materials lying around the shop.

As you can see, it's very DIY. A simple strap holds the neck and conforms to its shape, and some bubblewrap ensures the screws holding the strap don't brush up against the headstock. This design could obviously be improved.

I managed to find a sponge-like cleaning item, with a shape perfect for guitar necks. The key here is to find anything foamy and soft, and cut the shape out to match a guitar neck's profile. It was a little shorter than I wanted, so I glued some spare pieces of wood together, sanded the thing down and attached the foam headrest.

Final result:

Not too bad! Looks much better, take up less space, and no more metal to possibly cause scratches.
