Every guitar repair bench needs an elevated guitar neck/headstock rest. It keeps the headstock up off the surface, preventing scratches, detuning, and overall unnecessary damage to a sensitive part of the guitar. I didn't feel like buying one, and they seem easy to make, so I built a prototype from materials lying around the shop.

As you can see, it's very DIY. A simple strap holds the neck and conforms to its shape, and some bubblewrap ensures the screws holding the strap don't brush up against the headstock. This design could obviously be improved.
