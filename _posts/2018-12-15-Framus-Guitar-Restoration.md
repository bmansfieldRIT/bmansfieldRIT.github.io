I bought this guitar on Ebay for quite cheap, as apparently it was 'found in a barn'. And boy did it look like it. the first step was inspecting the guitar, at least what I could see under the filth.

As you can see, the guitar is extremely dirty, but in repairable/playable condition, if barely. The headstock has some splitting, but it does not look like anything structural. Could be glued together later. The truss rod cover, made of thin brass, is bent, and needs to be cleaned and bent back into place. A comparable replacement cover is rare, and I saw one listing on eBay for 70$. A repair it is then.

Look like this guitar is made in 1963, in Decemeber (the meaning of 63L, L being the 12 letter, representing the 12th month). With that knowledge, it brings this guitars condition from an F to a D- considering how old it is.

The bridge look slike it's chipped, and slightly pulling away from the top of the guitar.

The pickguard is sitting above the top of the guitar, most likely due to the soudhole 'dipping', due to the strings pulling the bridge and the neck closer together.

There is plenty of mold and dirt on the sides of the guitar, though underneath seems to be a beautiful wood pattern. I can't wait to get this guitar completely cleaned and repaired.

The back of the headstock looks fine, though the tunering knobs look to have been replaced, and could do with a brand new set of tuners. The neck has been broken and repaired, probably amateurly, given the glue residue left on the neck and the lack of paint coverup. probably fine to leave alone, but a paint job and a coat of laquer may be in order to restore a good playing feel to the neck. As it is, my hand feels slightly chippy around the 1 fret. The heel of the neck is split in one spot, and pulling away from the neck. I'm not sure how serious this is, but probably needs to be dealt with eventually.

The back and sides, showing just how beautiful this guitar is besides the dirt, mold and nicks.

Hard to see in this picture, but the bridge may have been replaced at one point, looks like another amateur cut job fitting the bridgepiece to the actual tailpiece.

The bridge is clearly pulling away from the top of the guitar.



So, we've examined the guitar and found some areas we can immediately start on. So, let's do it!

This is the fretboard after an initial dust off, and clean with gorgomite cloth. I wish I had a picture of the cleaning cloth, it is amazing how much filth was caked on the frets and fretboard. There remains some deeper cleaning to do on the fretboard itself.

These pictures show how the bridge is attached to the guitar, through two pole pieces driven through the guitar and bolted on with nuts and washers from the inside. I needed to unscrew these to get the bridge off, which was much harder than I anticipated.

After getting the bridge off, I realized the job was not going to be as simple as I had hoped. I believe the previous owner may have attempted to fix this guitar themselves at one point, or just wanted to replace the bridge. The bridge looks original to the guitar, but the massive holes, along with splintering indicate that someone ripped out the polepieces while attempting to remove the bridge. The original guitar probably didn't have washers holding the poles in place, but they became neccessary once the owner realized what they had done. The bridge mystery solved, I will now have to plot a way to fully repair the damage, and correctly seat a new bridge.

Unfortunately, when removing the pickguard, it snapped in half. You can see the line where it snapped, and where I super glued it back together. It is a shame, and I am currently thinking of ways to return it to one piece, as it is so beautiful, and will affect the resale value of the guitar.

After purchasing some thin clamps, I covered the guitar and bridge in glue, and clamped the bridge in place. I worry about the intonation, but since I do not have the tools to really test the intonation before gluing, I will attempt to return the bridge back to it's original position, which is all I can do currently.

The guitar came with a nut, which mysteriously did not fit the guitar and was not attached. I sanded the nut down to fit the slot.

Here is a view of the headstock after cleaning. I attempted to bend the truss rod cover into a flatter shape. It is rough, but workable.

Here are some photos of the guitar after a full clean and polish. It looks much better, and now only needs a new pickguard to be complete.

A close up view of the fretboard shows that the rot was deep, but after scraping out and cleaning, not unmanagemable. The neck plays fine in this area, and amounts to a aesthetic blemish.

At last, the restoration is complete! The pickguard has been added. Finding a replacement was harder than I anticipated, this being a guitar from the 60s, parts were scarce. I actually found a replacement truss rod cover as well, but I found it was not worth the 100$ price tag associated. This pickguard I found by laboriously searching for Framus parts, then giving up and simply crawling eBay for "vintage pickguards". Miraculously, I found an exact match. Well, almost. It may be hard to tell, but the pickguard, while almost certainly fromt he same model of guitar, is slightly smaller than the original. This may in fact be due to the changing properties of the material used for manufacturing pickguards, and their tendency to shrink over time, especially when not fixed in place on the guitar with screws. I did, unfortunately, have to drill new holes for the pickguard, which I did not want to do, but I saw no clear other alternative. The guitar looks much better, and has restored most of it's value lost by not having a pickguard. There is some overlap (underlap?) where the discoloration fo the previous pickguard can be seen near the neck, but I consider it a worthwhile tradeoff.
