Trying to install Windows on a driver via a usb stick with a windows installed by Mac's Bootcamp. I ran into this error: "Missing installation drivers when booting from a usb created by MCT". After very little luck searching online, I came across some advice given on a different issue, but which solved my problem, so I'm marrying the two together for any other unfortunate soul which might get the same error. The way I fixed it was by moving the usb stick to a USB 2.0 slot, not a usb 3.0 slot. Problem completely fixed
, no more error.
