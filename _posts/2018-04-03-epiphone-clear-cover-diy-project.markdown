This is a a cool project / modification that can be done to any guitar. I had the idea as I was wiring my bass guitar, I wanted to see the results of my work every time I looked at my bass.

Basically, I looked around the shop for a sheet of clear plastic, which actually came in the form of a plastic container. I traced the existing opaque cover, cut it out, and sanded down the edges until a perfect fit was achieved.

I decided to try an Epiphone Les Paul volume / tone cavity cover, with great results.

Now I can see my wiring mod I did, which was a 'Jimmy Page' mod, along with a Les Paul '50s' wiring mod.
